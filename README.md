# React_App
Bulding a React application for fun
NOTE: Still need to come up with main idea for the application!

# WorkFlow
1) Create an issue. Make sure to assign the appropriate person, add the apppropraite label, add Project_Board to Projects.
2) Double check the issue was added to the project board, if not please resolve.
3) When you want to work on an issue, move issue on project board to 'In progress'.
4) Create an branch for your issue, name it 'feature_#[issue num]'.
5) Use 'git fetch' to grab your newly created branch.
6) Use 'git checkout [branch name]' to switch to your newly created branch, then work on issue.
7) Once issue is resolved, commit the changes with a relevant and informative message, then push changes to your branch.
8) Create a pull request, mergeing to main, link the issue in your pull request by adding one of the following words to the description:
close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved. Follow this by a space and '#[your issue num]'.
Choose a reviewer, and put your issue in the 'Review' category on the project board, and wait for the review to be finished.
Make sure to also fill in the relevant information for other categories like: Assignees, Labels, and Projects.
9) Once a review is done and the reviewer approves, merge the changes into main. This should put your issue in the 'Done' category
on the project board.
